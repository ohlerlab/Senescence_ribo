IMR90 cells.

overall translation is increased flourescence of ribosomes is stronger.
EIF4F examined first - central role in initiation. most important rate limiting step.
EIF4G scaffold protein downregulated in senescent cells.
SO we expect cap dependent translation to decrease.
Looking at which mRNAs are actively translated.
Can we find a cap independent translation mechanism.
IS there something special signature in the 5' UTR
	sequence analysis (meme?) obvious next step
